## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chernistry/jobfuq.git
cd jobfuq
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure `jobfuq/conf/config.toml`

Edit this file to set up your environment:

- **linkedin_credentials:** Add one or more LinkedIn logins.
- **search_queries:** Define your target job keywords, locations, and filters.
- **ai_providers:** Configure your AI provider mode (`"together"`, `"openrouter"`, or `"multi"`), API keys, and models.
- **prompt:** Path to your custom career prompt (e.g., `prompts/deepsek_r1_career_career_advisor_devops.txt`).
- **scraping:** Set the mode (`stealth`, `normal`, or `aggressive`) and other options like `user_agents`.
- **time_filter:** Use a relative time filter (e.g., `"1209600"` for 2 weeks) to limit postings.
- **max_postings:** The maximum number of jobs to scrape per query.
- **headless:** Toggle headless mode for browser automation.

> **Warning:** DO NOT use your personal LinkedIn account‚Äîuse a dummy/test account if you plan on scraping.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Customize Your Prompt

- Head over to `jobfuq/prompts/` and edit an existing template or create your own.
- Remove `<think>` sections if your chosen model doesn‚Äôt support chain-of-thought.
- Update the `prompt` field in your config accordingly.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run JOBFUQ

**Combined Scrape & Process (Recommended):**

```bash
python -m jobfuq.scraper --recipe "scrap,process" --verbose [--hours <num>]
```

- **Note:** If you're using stealth scraping more (which, of course, we *hope* you do), it may take up to a minute between launching the scraper and the actual scraping. Don't worry! :)

**Run Separately:**

- **Scraper:**  
  ```bash
  python -m jobfuq.scraper [--manual-login] [--debug-single] [--endless] [--verbose] [--hours <num>]
  ```

- **Processor:**  
  ```bash
  python -m jobfuq.processor [config_path] [--verbose] [--endless] [--threads <num>]
  ```

> **Tip:** Use the `--hours <num>` flag to limit results to jobs posted within the last `<num>` hours.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Inspect & Query Your Results

- All scraped jobs are stored in the SQLite database located at `data/job_listings.db`.
- Use your favorite SQLite GUI (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver, or SQLiteStudio) to inspect the data.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Highlights

### Key Tables:

- **job_listings:** Stores all job data along with evaluation metrics.
- **blacklist:** Contains keywords or companies to exclude from results.
- **blacklisted_companies:** Specific companies that are banned from scraping.

### Notable Fields in `job_listings`:

- `title`, `company`, `company_url`, `location`, `description`
- `remote_allowed`, `job_state`
- `company_size` & `company_size_score`
- `job_url`, `date`, `listed_at`
- AI-evaluated metrics: `skills_match`, `model_fit_score`, `preliminary_score`, `success_probability`, `role_complexity`, `effort_days_to_fit`, `critical_skill_mismatch_penalty`, `experience_gap`
- `overall_relevance`, `last_checked`, `last_reranked`, `application_status`


---

## ü§ñ AI Integration & Scoring

### Provider Configuration

The `[ai_providers]` section in `config.toml` lets you choose between:

- **together:** Runs models via Together.ai (e.g., `Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo`).
- **openrouter:** Allows you to use OpenRouter‚Äôs free endpoints (e.g., `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`) ‚Äì
  or go for paid ones if you want better performance.
- **multi:** Alternates between providers for load balancing.

> **Note:** The **multi** mode is highly experimental and prone to errors. If you're feeling brave,
> fork it and improve it. Otherwise, it's safer to stick to a single provider.
>
> If you're on a budget, here are some solid free options:
>
> - `openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` ‚Äì fast, decent intelligence.
> - `deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free` ‚Äì more thoughtful, but still efficient.
> - `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free` ‚Äì slow as hell on the free tier, but hey, it's **R1**.

Example configuration:

```toml
[Example AI Provider Config]
[ai_providers]
provider_mode = "together"
threads = 4
together_api_key = "your_together_api_key_here"
together_model = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo"
together_rpm = 58
prompt = "prompts/deepseek_r1_career_advisor_template.txt"
```

### Evaluation Workflow

- The AI model evaluates each job based on a custom prompt that includes:
  - Company, Title, Location, and Job Description.
- **Scoring Metrics** include:
  - `skills_match`
  - `experience_gap`
  - `model_fit_score`
  - `success_probability`
  - `role_complexity`
  - `effort_days_to_fit`
  - `critical_skill_mismatch_penalty`

- The final **Preliminary Score** is computed in `jobfuq/processor.py` using:
  - A penalty for experience gaps and critical mismatches.
  - Adjustments for recency and company size.

- Results are displayed in a snarky ASCII gradient output for your viewing pleasure.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration & Customization

### Configuration Files

- **Main Config:** `jobfuq/conf/config.toml`
   - Controls scraping behavior, AI provider settings, and database paths.
- **LinkedIn Config:** `jobfuq/conf/linked_config.toml`
   - Contains detailed selectors and browser options for LinkedIn scraping.
- **SQL Queries:** Located in `jobfuq/sql/`
   - Modify these if you need to adjust the schema or query logic.

### Customizable Options

- **Scraping Mode:**  
  - Options: `"stealth"` (default), `"normal"`, or `"aggressive"`.
- **User Agents:**  
  - A list of modern browser signatures to reduce detection.
- **Timeouts & Delays:**  
  - Adjust `selector_timeout`, `get_text_timeout`, and `retry_delay` to fine-tune performance.
- **Session Management:**  
  - Sessions are stored in the `session_store` directory. Use manual login (`--manual-login`) if needed.

### Modifying Scoring Factors

All scoring logic is in `jobfuq/processor.py` and can be modified there if you‚Äôre feeling brave.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Detection & Stealth Features

JOBFUQ now comes equipped with a range of anti-detection measures:

- **Randomized Mouse Movements & Scrolling Patterns:** Simulates human behavior.
- **Dynamic Viewport Resizing & Network Throttling:** Adjusts to avoid detection.
- **Fake HTTP Traffic Generation:** Keeps your scraping footprint under the radar.
- **Manual Captcha Handling:** Automatically switches to headful mode when necessary.

All these features are implemented in `jobfuq/linked_utils.py` and can be fine-tuned via `linked_config.toml`.

---

## üìä Viewing & Analyzing Results

### Output Metrics

- **Preliminary Score:** Overall job fit (0-100).
- **Skills Match:** How well your skills align.
- **Model Fit Score:** LLM‚Äôs evaluation of job suitability.
- **Success Probability:** Your chance of landing the job.
- **Effort Days to Fit:** Estimated days to bridge any skill gaps.
- **Critical Skill Mismatch Penalty:** Higher values indicate bigger gaps.

### ASCII Gradient Visualization

The processor displays results using an ASCII gradient:

- Red blocks indicate poor scores.
- Green blocks indicate strong alignment.

This visual output is handled by `jobfuq/processor.py` and is as aesthetically pleasing as it is brutally honest.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Running in Different Modes

### Continuous (Endless) Mode

Run the scraper or processor in an endless loop with the `--endless` flag:

```bash
python -m jobfuq.scraper --endless --verbose
```

### Debug Mode

For debugging a single job, use:

```bash
python -m jobfuq.scraper --debug-single [job_URL]
```

This is perfect if you just want to see what‚Äôs wrong with a particular posting.

## üìú SQL Queries Cheat Sheet

### Common Queries

- **Insert Job:** Inserts or updates a job listing.
- **Get Jobs for Scoring:** Retrieves unprocessed jobs for AI evaluation.
- **Update Job Scores:** Writes the AI evaluation back to the database.
- **Blacklist Checks:** Ensures unwanted jobs are filtered out.

All SQL files are located in `jobfuq/sql/` and are loaded dynamically by `jobfuq/database.py`.
