Contributing to JobFuq

Thanks for your interest in JobFuq! Your contributions help refine job search automation, AI-powered ranking, and scraping efficiency. Please review these guidelines before submitting code, bug reports, or feature ideas.

Contribution Guidelines

Issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Clearly describe the problem: include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and logs/screenshots when relevant.
- If proposing an enhancement, explain the problem it solves and its expected impact.

Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused: one feature, fix, or enhancement per PR.
- Reference the related issue (e.g., "Fixes #123") if applicable.
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.11+ and adhere to PEP 8, PEP 20, and PEP 257.
- Use type hints, docstrings, and meaningful commit messages.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; optimize imports and code structure.
- Performance matters: optimize DB queries, concurrency (asyncio, multiprocessing), and minimize API rate-limit issues.
- Test before submitting: run unit tests (pytest) and integration tests (Playwright for scraping features).

Code Quality & Design
- Follow SOLID principles and use appropriate design patterns.
- When modifying AI-based ranking, justify changes in scoring logic with data-backed reasoning.
- Ensure new features donâ€™t degrade job-matching accuracy or introduce unintended biases.
- Use lazy evaluation techniques (e.g., generators, async iterators) to handle large datasets efficiently.

Security & API Best Practices
- No hardcoded credentials. Use environment variables or .env files for sensitive data.
- Prevent bot detection pitfalls.
- Secure API calls with parameterized queries and input validation.
- Encrypt or hash stored credentials (bcrypt, secrets), and follow OAuth/token best practices.

Community & Communication
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature suggestions.
- For deeper technical discussions, consider opening a GitHub Discussion.
