### What‚Äôs New?

- **Fully Free AI via OpenRouter:** Now you can use the AI integration entirely for free through OpenRouter, removing previous usage restrictions.
- **Two-Pass Scoring System:**
    - **First Pass:** A lighter, preliminary model quickly scores all scraped jobs.
    - **Second Pass (Rescoring):** Top vacancies are then re-evaluated in-depth using a more advanced model for improved accuracy.
- **Enhanced Configuration Defaults:** Updated `config.toml` now features a longer `time_filter` (e.g., "2419200" for 4 weeks), reduced `concurrent_details`, and a lower `max_postings` value.
- **LinkedIn Scraping Enhancements:** Refined selectors in `linked_config.toml` and improved stealth techniques (randomized mouse physics, dynamic viewport resizing, fake HTTP traffic, etc.).
- **Database Schema Overhaul:** Additional SQL scripts now manage blacklist tables and support the two-pass scoring workflow.
- **Modular Scraping Flows:** Refactored into distinct flows (search, details, update) managed by the orchestrator for better process control.

---

## üöÄ So-called "Quick" start
For now, this process may seem a bit manual‚Äîespecially in adjusting filters to avoid unwanted jobs. We plan to simplify the process in future releases, but for now, it is what it is.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chernistry/jobfuq.git
cd jobfuq
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure `jobfuq/conf/config.toml`

Edit this file to set up your environment:

- **linkedin_credentials:** Add one or more LinkedIn logins.
- **search_queries:** Define your target job keywords, locations, and filters. **Note:** Adjust the filter settings to exclude jobs you want to avoid.
- **ai_providers:** Configure your AI provider mode (`"together"`, `"openrouter"`, or `"multi"`), API keys, and models.
- **prompt:** Path to your custom career prompt (e.g., `prompts/deepseek_r1_career_advisor_template.txt`).
- **scraping:** Set the mode (`stealth`, `normal`, or `aggressive`) and other options like `user_agents`.
- **time_filter:** Use a relative time filter (e.g., `"2419200"` for 4 weeks) to limit postings.
- **max_postings:** The maximum number of jobs to scrape per query.
- **headless:** Toggle headless mode for browser automation.

> **Warning:** DO NOT use your personal LinkedIn account‚Äîuse a dummy/test account if you plan on scraping.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Customize Your Prompt

- Head over to `jobfuq/prompts/` and edit an existing template or create your own.
- Remove `<think>` sections if your chosen model doesn‚Äôt support chain-of-thought.
- Update the `prompt` field in your config accordingly.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run JOBFUQ

**Combined Flows (Recommended):**

```bash
python -m jobfuq.scraper.orchestrator --recipe "search+details" --verbose [--hours <num>]
```


**Combined Flows (Recommended):**

```bash
python -m jobfuq.scraper.orchestrator --recipe "search+details" --verbose [--hours <num>]
```

- **Run Separately:**

- **Scraper:**
  ```bash
  python -m jobfuq.scraper.orchestrator [--manual-login] [--debug-single] [--endless] [--verbose] [--hours <num>]
  ```

- **Processor (Two-Pass Scoring):**
  ```bash
  python -m jobfuq.processing.processor [config_path] [--verbose] [--endless] [--threads <num>] [--recipe scoring/rescoring/all]
  ```

> **Tip:** Use the `--hours <num>` flag to limit results to jobs posted within the last `<num>` hours.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Inspect & Query Your Results

- All scraped jobs are stored in the SQLite database located at the path specified in your config (e.g., `data/job_listings.db`).
- Use your favorite SQLite GUI (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver, or SQLiteStudio) to inspect the data.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Highlights

### Key Tables:

- **job_listings:** Stores all job data along with evaluation metrics.

### Notable Fields in `job_listings`:

- `title`, `company`, `company_url`, `location`, `description`
- `remote_allowed`, `job_state`
- `company_size` & `company_size_score`
- `job_url`, `date`, `listed_at`
- AI-evaluated metrics: `skills_match`, `model_fit_score`, `preliminary_score`, `success_probability`, `role_complexity`, `effort_days_to_fit`, `critical_skill_mismatch_penalty`, `experience_gap`
- `last_checked`, `last_reranked`, `is_posted`, `application_status`

---

## ü§ñ AI Integration & Scoring

### Provider Configuration

The `[ai_providers]` section in `config.toml` lets you choose between:

- **together:** Runs models via Together.ai (e.g., `Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo`).
- **openrouter:** Now supports fully free usage for AI evaluation (e.g., `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`).
- **multi:** Alternates between providers for load balancing.

> **Note:** The **multi** mode is experimental. If you‚Äôre feeling brave, fork it and improve it; otherwise, stick to a single provider.

Example configuration:

```toml
[ai_providers]
provider_mode = "together"
threads = 4
together_api_key = "your_together_api_key_here"
together_model = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo"
together_rpm = 58
prompt = "prompts/deepseek_r1_career_advisor_template.txt"
```

### Two-Pass Evaluation Workflow

- **First Pass (Preliminary Scoring):**
    - A lightweight model quickly scores all scraped jobs.
- **Second Pass (Rescoring):**
    - Top vacancies (as identified by the preliminary pass) are re-evaluated in-depth by a more advanced model.
    - This results in more accurate and reliable job fit assessments.

### Scoring Metrics

- **Skills Match:** Alignment between candidate skills and job requirements.
- **Experience Gap:** Difference between candidate experience and role expectations.
- **Model Fit Score:** AI‚Äôs overall evaluation of job suitability.
- **Success Probability:** Likelihood of landing the job.
- **Role Complexity:** Demands of the position.
- **Effort Days to Fit:** Estimated days to bridge skill gaps.
- **Critical Skill Mismatch Penalty:** Penalties for missing key qualifications.

The final **Preliminary Score** is computed in `jobfuq/processing/processor.py` using these metrics, with adjustments for recency and company size.
